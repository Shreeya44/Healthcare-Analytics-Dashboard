# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project involves analyzing state-wide hospital discharge data using Power BI to identify efficiency improvement opportunities. The focus is on elective hip replacement surgeries, using key metrics like Length of Stay (LOS) and associated costs. The dashboard provides actionable insights for healthcare management to make data-driven decisions.  

## Features  
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Explored and analyzed state-wide hospital discharge data.  
  - Focused on metrics such as LOS and associated costs to evaluate hospital efficiency.  

- **Dashboard Development:**  
  - Designed interactive Power BI dashboards for visualizing key metrics.  
  - Included visualizations to highlight factors impacting LOS, such as patient age, diagnosis, and severity of illness.  

- **Insights Delivery:**  
  - Provided actionable insights to stakeholders for improving throughput, resource management, and cost reduction.
